## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really loved this challenge! It made me think a lot, because I wanted to practice VanillaJS so bad that I made this form validation fully Vanilla, no APIs or Libraries, from scratch. Mainly, because I didn't like any kind of tutorials that I came across. I thought every tutorial was so simple and at the same time, so wack and long that I couldn't maintain my attention. I made a flowchart for doing this, as well as some testing on paper. I really had so much fun making this and I'm happy that it went so well for me. 

### Continued development

I think that I would copy just this try in every validation form I have to do on a long basis, because that will save me so much time to make a bigger webpage.

### Useful resources

- [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - This helped me for the RegEx expression. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

## Acknowledgments

I was really scary of doing it and even with the design done for two weeks, I tried to not touch it a lot for not getting overwhelmed of it. Even though, It's very pretty and functional btw!

I recommend to anyone first write the process, each step. That would help you a lot!
